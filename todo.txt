TODO:

- able to plot accuracy during training (needed for Q2)
        * EValuation set TODO
- see if performance is correct (loss that increases again)
        * DONE

- merge: all relevant things together
        * Arguments (basic evaluator, merged tree evaluator, n)
                * TODO fix infinite loop with n_digits!!

- Is de evaluator juist?
        * 

- experiments: 
        - Q1 scalability of logic engine when n_classes is increased?
                * Maarten: al eens checken
        - Q2 How does the accuracy evolve over during training?
        - Q3 Effect of semantics? Plot their learning curves
        - Q4 Scalability of system when n_digits is increased?
                * n_digits: DONE

- 2 extra experiments + optimization
    bv
        - caching? Impact on performance?
                * Caching van de boom : per epoch -> done
                * Caching van de neurale netten : per iteratie -> done
        - robustness to input -> add noise
        - improved forward chaining algorithm

- new application proposal

- write report
