TODO:

- able to plot accuracy during training (needed for Q2)
- see if performance is correct (loss that increases again) 

- merge: all relevant things together

- experiments: 
        - Q1 scalability of logic engine when n_classes is increased?
        - Q2 How does the accuracy evolve over during training?
        - Q3 Effect of semantics? Plot their learning curves
        - Q4 Scalability of system when n_digits is increased?

- 2 extra experiments + optimization
    bv
        - caching? Impact on performance?
        - robustness to input -> add noise
        - improved forward chaining algorithm

- new application proposal

- write report
